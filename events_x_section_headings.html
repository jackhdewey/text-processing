For example, let’s say that there are discs that flash on screen, one at a time, for one second each time. This pattern continues over and over, but suddenly, one of the discs expands. Despite the fact that the disc appears on screen for same duration as the rest of the other discs, many studies have demonstrated that we automatically and uncontrollably perceive this particular expanding disc as lasting noticeably longer than the actual 1 second display time (Tse, 2004).</p><h5>THE CURRENT STUDY</h5><p>Although the literature has covered quite extensively how oddballs affect a person’s perception of time for the oddball itself, it is unclear how oddballs affect a person’s perception of time for the objects besides the oddball. As you experienced in this study, you were asked to replicate the duration of a specific colored disc. Sometimes, that disc had expanded rapidly, growing in size abnormally (therefore making it an oddball in the pattern of otherwise static and unmoving discs). However, other times, the duration you were asked to reproduce was that of a static disc.</p><p>Since the oddball expands perceived time, does it therefore shorten perceived time for the regular objects surrounding it? If the perceived durations of other objects are indeed shortened, this could suggest that we have a relatively inflexible perception of total duration for events. Meanwhile, it’s completely plausible that perceived duration of other objects besides the oddball are completely unaffected, such that the the oddball time dilation is purely restricted to the oddball itself.</p><h5>FURTHER READINGS</h5><p>Tse, P.U., Intriligator, J., Rivest, J., et al.
