The purpose of this study is to better understand how we see and how we think. Study activities will include examining simple displays and then responding by answering questions, pressing some keys, or using a computer mouse. Because these are activities that many people already experience hundreds or thousands of times every day, there are no risks involved in this study. The study may have no benefits to you, but it may help the scientific community come to better understand how the human mind works. Taking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part, or you can choose not to take part in this study. You can also change your mind at any time, with no penalty.</p><h5>DURATION</h5><p>If you agree to take part, the study will last approximately <strong> 12 minutes</strong>.</p><h5>COSTS AND COMPENSATION</h5><p>There are no costs associated with participation in this study. You will receive <strong>$1.62</strong> for participating.</p><h5>CONFIDENTIALITY</h5><p>No personally identifying information will be collected, so your participation will be anonymous. Your data will be pooled with those from other participants, and may be included in scientific publications and uploaded to public data repositories.</p><h5>LEARNING MORE</h5><p>If you have questions about this study, you may contact your experimenter Joan Ongchoco at joan.ongchoco@yale.edu. If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or you have complaints about this research, you can contact the Yale Institutional Review Boards at 203-785-4688 or hrpp@yale.edu.</p><h5>INFORMED CONSENT</h5><p>Your participation indicates that you have read and understood this consent form and the information presented and that you agree to be in this study.</p></div></div><h2 style='text-align: center'>PRESS THE Y KEY TO CONSENT</h2><p></p><p></p>","89","5ed4954aea62124652e189c9_1649962444265","consent","https://perceptionexperiments.net/JD/exehe/expt.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
